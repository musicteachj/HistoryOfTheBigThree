			    <td>CSS</td>
			    <td>1996</td>
			    <td>The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published on December 17, 1996.</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>CSS 2</td>
			    <td>1998</td>
			    <td>A superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities like absolute, relative, and fixed positioning of elements and z-index, the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets (which were later replaced by the CSS 3 speech modules) and bidirectional text, and new font properties such as shadows.</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>CSS 2.1</td>
			    <td>2011</td>
			    <td>CSS level 2 revision 1, often referred to as "CSS 2.1", fixes errors in CSS 2, removes poorly supported or not fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extensions to the specification.</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>CSS 3</td>
			    <td>2012</td>
			    <td>Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility.</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>CSS 4</td>
			    <td>2017</td>
			    <td>There is no single, integrated CSS4 specification, because it is split into separate "level 4" modules. Because CSS3 split the CSS language's definition into modules, the modules have been allowed to level independently.</td>
